# CodeWyrm-Grammars
All of my personal grammars. Building them for [Dragonfly2](https://dragonfly2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)/[Natlink](https://qh.antenna.nl/unimacro/index.html)/[Dragon](https://www.nuance.com/dragon/support/dragon-naturallyspeaking.html), but originally used with [Dragonfly2](https://dragonfly2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)/[WSR](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-voice-recognition-in-windows-10-83ff75bd-63eb-0b6c-18d4-6fae94050571).

I'm currently no longer using this grammar, in part because my hands have recovered but also because I would like to migrate to [Talon](https://talonvoice.com/) because it has new features and supports Python 3. While I'm at it, I'll also probably document that new system and make it a little more accessable. That being said, this is more for my own personal use, so whatever I make that replaces CodeWyrm will likely still be missing certain features that are common to other grammars.

For anyone looking through this repo, I will say this doesn't really reflect my typical coding style. A ton of this code was written in a hurry and with gimpy hands. I needed something that worked and fast.
